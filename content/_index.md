# WebRTC For The Curious

## Introduction

_WebRTC For The Curious_ is an open-source book created by WebRTC implementers to share their hard-earned knowledge 
with the world. It's written for those who are always looking for more and don't settle for abstraction.

### Key features

- Focus on protocols and APIs, not specific software.
- Summarizes RFCs and collects undocumented knowledge.
- Vendor-agnostic approach.
- Not a tutorial - contains minimal code.

WebRTC is a powerful technology, but it can be challenging to use. This book aims to provide a comprehensive, unbiased 
resource for understanding WebRTC.

## Who this book is for

- Developers new to WebRTC, wanting to learn more.
- Current WebRTC developers seeking deeper understanding beyond APIs.
- Established developers needing debugging help.
- WebRTC implementers requiring clarification on specific parts.

## Book structure

### Designed for multiple readings

Each chapter is self-contained, allowing you to start anywhere in the book without getting lost.

### Chapter format
Each chapter answers a single question with three levels of information:
1. What needs to be solved?
2. How do we solve it? (Including technical details)
3. Where to learn more.

### No prior knowledge required
You can begin learning at any point in the book. We also provide resources for further study on individual topics.
Other books cover individual topics in much greater depth. This book aims to teach you the entire system, at the cost 
of expert level details.
